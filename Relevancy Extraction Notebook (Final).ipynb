      "\tObjective: To analyze clinical characteristics and risk factors of very low birth weight and extremely low birth weight infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Methods: A retrospective epidemiological study was performed in 768 neonates (376 males) with birth weights<1 500 g and gestational age ≤ 34 weeks who survived ≥28 days. Clinical data were obtained from the multi-center clinical database of neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in 19 hospitals of Jiangsu Province between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. These infants were divided into non-BPD group and BPD group according to BPD diagnositic criteria. Clinical features and potential risk factors were compared between groups with Chi-square test or nonparametric test. Risk factors for BPD were analyzed with Logistic regression analysis. Results: Among the total of 768 eligible neonates, 577 without BPD, 191 with BPD (24.9%). Mild, moderate and severe BPD accounted for 73.3% (140/191), 23.6% (45/191) and 3.1% (6/191) of all BPD cases respectively. There were significant differences in the average gestational age (29 (28, 30) vs. 30 (29, 31) weeks) or the average birth weight (1 170 (990, 1 300) vs. 1 300 (1 160, 1 400) g) between BPD group and non-BPD group (Z=-9.959,-7.202, both P=0.000). The incidences of BPD in the infants with gestational age of<28 weeks, 28-31 weeks and 32-34 weeks were 51.7% (46/89), 24.8% (139/561), 5.1% (6/118) respectively. The incidences of BPD in infants with birth weight<1 000 g, 1 000- 1 249 g and 1 250-1 500 g were 62.3% (48/77), 25.9% (70/270) and 17.3% (73/421) respectively. Proportion of male (55.5% (106/191) vs. 46.8% (270/577)), rate and length of conventional mechanical ventilation (48.7% (93/191) vs. 14.9% (86/577), 120 (72, 259) vs. 80 (29, 144)h), initial inhaled oxygen concentration and maximum inhaled oxygen concentration (0.35 (0.30, 0.40) vs. 0.30(0.25, 0.40), 0.40 (0.30, 0.50) vs. 0.30 (0.30, 0.40)) and volume of red blood cell transfusion (53(30, 90) vs.38(28, 55) ml) were higher in BPD group than in non-BPD group (χ(2)=4.350, 91.640, Z=-3.557, -2.848, -3.776, -4.677, all P<0.05). Rate of continuous positive airway pressure (12.6%(24/191) vs. 19.4%(112/577)) during neonatal resuscitation in delivery room was lower in BPD group than that in non-BPD group (χ(2)=4.614, P=0.032). The incidences of complications in BPD group including severe asphyxia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns (PPHN), patent ductus arteriosus, anemia of prematurity, early onset sepsis, clinical sepsis and ventilator associated pneumonia were higher than that in non-BPD group (15.2%(29/191) vs. 4.5% (26/577), 91.1% (174/191) vs. 56.7% (327/577), 2.6% (5/191) vs. 0.2% (1/577), 43.5% (83/191) vs. 34.2% (197/577), 88.0% (168/191) vs. 58.8% (339/577), 15.7% (30/191) vs. 9.9% (57/577), 42.9% (82/191) vs. 18.6% (107/577), 14.1% (27/191) vs. 2.3% (13/577); χ(2)=24.605, 74.993, 9.167, 5.373, 61.866, 4.557, 43.149, 34.315, all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NRDS (OR=4.651, 95%CI: 1.860-11.625), clinical sepsis (OR=1.989, 95%CI: 1.067-3.708), ventilator associated pneumonia (OR=3.155, 95%CI: 1.060-9.388), conventional mechanical ventilation (OR=2.298, 95%CI: 1.152-4.586), and volume of red blood cell transfusion (OR=1.013, 95%CI: 1.002-1.024) were risk factors of BPD. Conclusions: BPD is more common in very low birth weight infants of male with gestational age less than 32 weeks. Using CPAP in the delivery room, active treatment of NRDS, preventing nosocomial infection, and reducing invasive ventilation and red blood cell transfusion may decrease the incidence of BPD.\n",

      "\tSleep disorders encompass a wide spectrum of diseases with significant individual health consequences and high economic costs to society. To facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, this review provides a framework using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Primary and secondary insomnia are differentiated, and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments are discussed. Common circadian rhythm disorders are described in conjunction with interventions, including chronotherapy and light therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder is addressed. Attention is focused on obstructive sleep apnea and upper airway resistance syndrome, and their treatment. The constellation of symptoms and findings in narcolepsy are reviewed together with diagnostic testing and therapy, Parasomnias, including sleep terrors, somnambulism, and rapid eye movement (REM) behavior sleep disorders are described, together with associated laboratory testing results and treatment.\n",

      "\tAIMS: People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) suffer from sleep disorders, with the mechanism not clearly understood. In T2D, the light transducing retinal photoreceptors that regulate sleep behaviours are dysfunctional; hence, we determine here whether supplemental light exposure ameliorates sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in T2D. METHODS: Supplemental light (10,000 Lux, polychromatic) was self-administered for 30 min every morning for 14 days by ten participants with T2D with no diabetic retinopathy (DR). The effectiveness of supplemental light was assessed by comparing subjective sleep questionnaire (PSQI and ESS) scores and salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) before and after the light exposure as well as with a self-maintained sleep diary during the light exposure. RESULTS: Compared to the baseline, supplemental light significantly improved the excessive daytime sleepiness score (p = 0.004) and phase-advanced the DLMO on average by ~ 23 min. Sleep diary analyses showed that afternoon nap duration significantly shortened over the first week of supplemental light exposure (p = 0.019). Afternoon naps and midnight awakening were significantly longer in diabetic participants with thinner perifoveal retina. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series, we provide initial evidence that supplemental bright light improves daytime sleepiness in T2D with no DR, with the critical period of light exposure showing a beneficial effect after one week. We infer that supplemental light augments photoreceptor signalling in T2D and therefore optimises circadian photoentrainment leading to improved sleep. Our findings inform the development of tailored light therapy protocols in future clinical trials for improving sleep architecture in diabetes.\n",

      "\tAlthough complaints of impaired daytime functioning are essential to the diagnosis of primary insomnia, objective evidence for cognitive dysfunction has been hard to establish. A prerequisite for understanding the neurocognitive consequences of primary insomnia is to establish task paradigms that robustly differentiate insomniacs from well-sleeping subjects. We hypothesized that the decline in performance that typically occurs with an increasing cognitive demand would provide a more sensitive measure than performance on a single task version. The hypothesis was tested, first, by assessing the performance on two vigilance tasks with different cognitive demands in 25 elderly patients with primary insomnia and 13 healthy well-sleeping age-matched subjects. Secondly, we investigated the performance response to sleep therapy using a waiting-list controlled design. Sleep therapy consisted of a multi-component intervention including sleep restriction, cognitive behavioral therapy, bright-light therapy, structured physical activity and body temperature manipulations. The results show that insomniacs differed markedly from controls in their reaction times across tasks with different cognitive demands: patients responded faster on the 'simple' vigilance task, yet slower on the 'complex' vigilance task. Sleep therapy effectively restored normal performance: patients became significantly slower on the 'simple' task and faster on the 'complex' task, returning to the performance levels of control subjects. These findings indicate that the performance decline associated with increasing cognitive demands is possibly the first sensitive and robust measure of the neurocognitive sequelae of insomnia. We suggest that future studies on cognition in primary insomnia should apply a design that varies task demands.\n",
      "Amara, A. W., et al. (2017). \"Treatment of Sleep Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease.\" Curr Treat Options Neurol 19(7): 26.\n",
      "\tImpaired sleep and alertness affect the majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, negatively impacting safety and quality of life. The etiology of impaired sleep-wake cycle in PD is multifactorial and encompasses medication side effects, nocturnal PD motor symptoms, and presence of co-existent sleep and neuropsychiatric disorders. The primary neurodegenerative process of PD involves brain regions that regulate the sleep-wake cycle, such as brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei. Sleep disorders in PD include insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep disordered breathing (SDB), restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian disruption. Despite its high prevalence in the PD population, there is a paucity of clinical studies that have investigated treatment of sleep dysfunction associated with PD. Therefore, we aim to review available evidence and outline treatment strategies for improvement of disorders of sleep and wakefulness in PD patients. Evidence supporting the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies in PD is limited. There is thus a great need but also opportunity for development of well-designed clinical trials for impaired sleep and alertness in PD. Providing education about sleep hygiene and strategies for its implementation represents the initial step in management. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of co-existent primary sleep and psychiatric disorders are critical, as this may significantly improve sleep and alertness. While the optimal treatment for insomnia in PD has not been established, available strategies include cognitive-behavioral therapy, medications with soporific properties, and light therapy. Safety measures, clonazepam, and melatonin are the mainstay of treatment for RBD. Continuous positive airway pressure is an effective treatment for SDB in PD. The treatment algorithm for RLS associated with PD mirrors that used for idiopathic RLS. Circadian disruption has emerged as an important etiology of impaired sleep-wake cycles in PD, and circadian-based interventions hold promise for novel treatment approaches.\n"

The incidences of complications in BPD group including severe asphyxia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns (PPHN), patent ductus arteriosus, anemia of prematurity, early onset sepsis, clinical sepsis and ventilator associated pneumonia were higher than that in non-BPD group (15.2%(29/191) vs. 4.5% (26/577), 91.1% (174/191) vs. 56.7% (327/577), 2.6% (5/191) vs. 0.2% (1/577), 43.5% (83/191) vs. 34.2% (197/577), 88.0% (168/191) vs. 58.8% (339/577), 15.7% (30/191) vs. 9.9% (57/577), 42.9% (82/191) vs. 18.6% (107/577), 14.1% (27/191) vs. 2.3% (13/577); χ(2)=24.605, 74.993, 9.167, 5.373, 61.866, 4.557, 43.149, 34.315, all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NRDS (OR=4.651, 95%CI: 1.860-11.625), clinical sepsis (OR=1.989, 95%CI: 1.067-3.708), ventilator associated pneumonia (OR=3.155, 95%CI: 1.060-9.388), conventional mechanical ventilation (OR=2.298, 95%CI: 1.152-4.586), and volume of red blood cell transfusion (OR=1.013, 95%CI: 1.002-1.024) were risk factors of BPD. Conclusions: BPD is more common in very low birth weight infants of male with gestational age less than 32 weeks. Using CPAP in the delivery room, active treatment of NRDS, preventing nosocomial infection, and reducing invasive ventilation and red blood cell transfusion may decrease the incidence of BPD.\n",

      "Abad, V. C. and C. Guilleminault\n",
      "Sleep disorders encompass a wide spectrum of diseases with significant individual health consequences and high economic costs to society. To facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, this review provides a framework using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Primary and secondary insomnia are differentiated, and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments are discussed. Common circadian rhythm disorders are described in conjunction with interventions, including chronotherapy and light therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder is addressed. Attention is focused on obstructive sleep apnea and upper airway resistance syndrome, and their treatment. The constellation of symptoms and findings in narcolepsy are reviewed together with diagnostic testing and therapy, Parasomnias, including sleep terrors, somnambulism, and rapid eye movement (REM) behavior sleep disorders are described, together with associated laboratory testing results and treatment.\n",

      "2021\n",
      "Adhikari, P., et al.\n",
      "AIMS: People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) suffer from sleep disorders, with the mechanism not clearly understood. In T2D, the light transducing retinal photoreceptors that regulate sleep behaviours are dysfunctional; hence, we determine here whether supplemental light exposure ameliorates sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in T2D. METHODS: Supplemental light (10,000 Lux, polychromatic) was self-administered for 30 min every morning for 14 days by ten participants with T2D with no diabetic retinopathy (DR). The effectiveness of supplemental light was assessed by comparing subjective sleep questionnaire (PSQI and ESS) scores and salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) before and after the light exposure as well as with a self-maintained sleep diary during the light exposure. RESULTS: Compared to the baseline, supplemental light significantly improved the excessive daytime sleepiness score (p = 0.004) and phase-advanced the DLMO on average by ~ 23 min. Sleep diary analyses showed that afternoon nap duration significantly shortened over the first week of supplemental light exposure (p = 0.019). Afternoon naps and midnight awakening were significantly longer in diabetic participants with thinner perifoveal retina. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series, we provide initial evidence that supplemental bright light improves daytime sleepiness in T2D with no DR, with the critical period of light exposure showing a beneficial effect after one week. We infer that supplemental light augments photoreceptor signalling in T2D and therefore optimises circadian photoentrainment leading to improved sleep. Our findings inform the development of tailored light therapy protocols in future clinical trials for improving sleep architecture in diabetes.\n",

      "2008\n",
      "Altena, E., et al.\n",
      "Although complaints of impaired daytime functioning are essential to the diagnosis of primary insomnia, objective evidence for cognitive dysfunction has been hard to establish. A prerequisite for understanding the neurocognitive consequences of primary insomnia is to establish task paradigms that robustly differentiate insomniacs from well-sleeping subjects. We hypothesized that the decline in performance that typically occurs with an increasing cognitive demand would provide a more sensitive measure than performance on a single task version. The hypothesis was tested, first, by assessing the performance on two vigilance tasks with different cognitive demands in 25 elderly patients with primary insomnia and 13 healthy well-sleeping age-matched subjects. Secondly, we investigated the performance response to sleep therapy using a waiting-list controlled design. Sleep therapy consisted of a multi-component intervention including sleep restriction, cognitive behavioral therapy, bright-light therapy, structured physical activity and body temperature manipulations. The results show that insomniacs differed markedly from controls in their reaction times across tasks with different cognitive demands: patients responded faster on the 'simple' vigilance task, yet slower on the 'complex' vigilance task. Sleep therapy effectively restored normal performance: patients became significantly slower on the 'simple' task and faster on the 'complex' task, returning to the performance levels of control subjects. These findings indicate that the performance decline associated with increasing cognitive demands is possibly the first sensitive and robust measure of the neurocognitive sequelae of insomnia. We suggest that future studies on cognition in primary insomnia should apply a design that varies task demands.\n",

      "Treatment of Sleep Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease.\n",
      "2017\n",
      "Amara, A. W., et al.\n",
      "Impaired sleep and alertness affect the majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, negatively impacting safety and quality of life. The etiology of impaired sleep-wake cycle in PD is multifactorial and encompasses medication side effects, nocturnal PD motor symptoms, and presence of co-existent sleep and neuropsychiatric disorders. The primary neurodegenerative process of PD involves brain regions that regulate the sleep-wake cycle, such as brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei. Sleep disorders in PD include insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep disordered breathing (SDB), restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian disruption. Despite its high prevalence in the PD population, there is a paucity of clinical studies that have investigated treatment of sleep dysfunction associated with PD. Therefore, we aim to review available evidence and outline treatment strategies for improvement of disorders of sleep and wakefulness in PD patients. Evidence supporting the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies in PD is limited. There is thus a great need but also opportunity for development of well-designed clinical trials for impaired sleep and alertness in PD. Providing education about sleep hygiene and strategies for its implementation represents the initial step in management. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of co-existent primary sleep and psychiatric disorders are critical, as this may significantly improve sleep and alertness. While the optimal treatment for insomnia in PD has not been established, available strategies include cognitive-behavioral therapy, medications with soporific properties, and light therapy. Safety measures, clonazepam, and melatonin are the mainstay of treatment for RBD. Continuous positive airway pressure is an effective treatment for SDB in PD. The treatment algorithm for RLS associated with PD mirrors that used for idiopathic RLS. Circadian disruption has emerged as an important etiology of impaired sleep-wake cycles in PD, and circadian-based interventions hold promise for novel treatment approaches.\n",
